# Performing Singular Value Decomposition
## AI 211 Coding Challenge 6

This code submission by Jan Lendl Uy comprises two files:

- Do_SVD.py
- Do_SVD_Tests.py

In `Do_SVD.py`, the algorithm for performing singular value decomposition (SVD) via the Golub-Kahan algorithm is found in this program. You may check this file to inspect the implementation of the algorithm.

On the other hand, `Do_SVD_Tests.py` contains the tests performed in verifying the correctness of the algorithm for doing singular value decomposition. RUN this file to check the results for different tests which include:

- Randomized testing for a symmetric matrix with random mxm size and random entries
