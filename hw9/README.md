# Performing Stochastic Gradient Descent
## AI 211 Coding Challenge 8

This code submission by Jan Lendl Uy comprises two files:

- Gradient_Descent.py
- Gradient_Descent_Tests.py

In `Gradient_Descent.py`, it contains the implementation for performing stochastic gradient descent. You may check this file to inspect the implementation of the algorithm.

On the other hand, `Gradient_Descent_Tests.py` contains the tests performed in verifying the correctness of the gradient descent. RUN this file to check the results for different tests which include:

- 4x4 dense matrix (all elements are nonzero)
- Randomized testing for a matrix with random size and entries
