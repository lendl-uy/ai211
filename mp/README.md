# AI 211 Machine Problem
## Transformer Architecture

This machine problem submission was created by the following people:

Found in this project directory are the following files:

- Transformer.py
- Transformer_Tests.py

In `Transformer.py`, it contains the transformer architecture written using the Numpy library in Python. It brings together the encoder and decoder blocks in `Encoder.py` and `Decoder.py`. Moreover, `Operational_Blocks.py` contains all the classes and functions that were needed to construct all layers in the architecture. You may check these files to inspect the implementation of the transformer.

Values of the hyperparameters and other variables used in the transformer modeling process may be changed in `Transformer_Constants.py`.

Lastly, `Partial Results/Transformer_Tests.py` contains functions that print the outputs of corresponding layers in the transformer architecture.  RUN this file to check the results for different tests. All tests are commented out in the `main()` function of the code. Uncomment one test at a time before running the program.

The rest of the files in `Partial Results` are copies of the same files in the parent directory but are slightly modified to print out some intermediary results.
