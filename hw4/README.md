# Computing the Hessenberg Matrix of a Square Matrix via Householder Transformation
## AI 211 Coding Challenge 4

This code submission by Jan Lendl Uy comprises two files:

- Get_Hessenberg.py
- Get_Hessenberg_Tests.py

In `Get_Hessenberg.py`, the algorithm for computing the Hessenberg matrix via Householder reflections is found in this program. You may check this file to inspect the implementation of the algorithm.

On the other hand, `Get_Hessenberg_Tests.py` contains the tests performed in verifying the correctness of the algorithm for computing the Hessenberg matrix. RUN this file to check the results of the factorization for different tests which include:

- A is the zero matrix
- A is a 4x4 matrix
- Randomized testing for random mxm size and random entries
